This package contains basic [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) config for use in my
personal projects. It is not meant to be used anywhere else. I won't provide
support and don't accept pull requests for this repo.

## üî• Installation

```bash
composer require eliashaeussler/phpstan-config
```

## ‚ö° Usage

### With extension installer

If you have the [`phpstan/extension-installer`](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer)
package installed, there's nothing more to do. The [base configuration](phpstan-base.neon.dist)
is automatically included.

### Manual include

Create a `phpstan.neon` and include the [`phpstan.neon.dist`](phpstan.neon.dist):

```neon
# phpstan.neon

includes:
  - %rootDir%/../../eliashaeussler/phpstan-config/phpstan.neon.dist
```
